# Alex73630's Advent of Code 2023 solutions

Watch me resolve each challenge live on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/alex73630)!

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenges.

## My setup

All solutions will be written in TypeScript and will be run with Node.js.

I'll be mostly using my project generator [create-a8-app](https://github.com/Alex73630/create-a8-app) to create each day's folder, to provide an empty NodeJS project with TypeScript support with all the dev tools I regularly use for my comfort.

I'll also force myself to create unit tests for each day's solution, using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), so I can test my solutions easily, make sure they work as intended and because I want to have some fun with Test Driven Development.

## Usage (for me so I don't forget)

Create a new day folder with the following command:

```bash
make create day=1
```
